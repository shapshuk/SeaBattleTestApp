- # Sea Battle Android (Test Assignment)

This project is an implementation of a test assignment for developing a Sea Battle game for Android using libGDX framework. The application demonstrates core game functionality along with advanced graphics features implemented through GLSL shaders.

## Assignment Requirements Implementation

### Core Functionality
- **libGDX framework**:
  Successfully implemented cross-platform game architecture using libGDX, supporting Android deployment with APK output.
- **Basic Game Implementation:**:
  Developed core Sea Battle mechanics including:
  - Ship placement system
  - Game board management
  - Basic algorithm for automatic ship arrangement

### Advanced Graphics Features
- **GLSL Shader Implementation**:
  Developed custom shader system featuring:
  - Dynamic texture masking
  - Real-time mask position updates
  - Dual-texture rendering capability
- **Masking System**:
  Implemented interactive mask that:
  - Can be moved across the game field
  - Reveals alternative textures for both background and ships
  - Supports custom mask shapes through texture input
  
## Technical Implementation
### Architecture
 - **Framework**: libGDX (Cross-platform game development)
 - **Language**: Kotlin (Modern, concise Android development)
 - **Graphics**: OpenGL ES with custom GLSL shaders
 - **Build System**: Gradle with Android Studio integration

## Key Components
 - **Shader System**:
   - Custom GLSL implementation
   - Dynamic texture masking
   - Real-time mask position updates
 - **Game Logic**:
   - Rule-based ship placement
   - State management system
   - Auto-placement algorithm

## UI System:
 - Multiple scene navigation
 - Touch event handling
 - Adaptive layout system
